# Doped Alumina Ceramics — Metallurgy Research Project

This repository contains the final project report for my undergraduate research on the synthesis and characterization of pure and doped alumina ceramics for microwave dielectric applications. The study evaluates how dopants influence phase stability, microstructure, mechanical properties, and dielectric performance.

## 🔬 Project Overview
The project involved preparing alumina samples doped with Fe₂O₃, TiO₂, Cr₂O₃, and V₂O₅ through multi-cycle sintering, followed by comprehensive characterization across structural, mechanical, and dielectric domains.

### Key analyses performed:
- **X-Ray Diffraction (XRD):** Phase identification and confirmation of α-Al₂O₃ stability.
- **Hardness Testing:** Rockwell superficial hardness across all sintered samples.
- **Compression Testing:** Mechanical strength evaluation of pure and doped alumina.
- **Dielectric Characterization:** Using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) at GHz frequencies to measure dielectric constant and loss tangent.
- **Impedance Spectroscopy:** Bode plots and relaxation analysis for electrical behavior.
